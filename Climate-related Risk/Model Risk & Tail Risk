A Perspective: Model Risk and Fat Tail Risk in the Climate-Related Risks (CRRs)

Climate-related Risks (CRRs) arise from a highly complex climate system. CRRs, as they intensify, could manifest progressively increasing correlations and unprecedented non-linear developments among risk variable.  If not alleviated, they would drive an irreversible systemic paradigm shift in the climate systemâ€™s equilibrium . CRRs could pose detrimental fat tail risk to our human life. A problem is that they are difficult to model.
Typically, there are two types of risk associated with model uses: model risk and tail risk.
